# Description:

This repository contains of my own <b><a href="https://ammnt.com/filter.txt">filter</a></b> for <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home.html"><b>AdGuard Home</a></b> that blocks:
- Adware, spyware, malware and ransomware domains and their subdomains;
- Phishing, fraud, fake and scam hosts and their subdomains;
- Advertising, CPA and banner networks domains and their subdomains;
- Tracking and telemetry hosts and their subdomains;
- CNAME cloacking, analytics and metrics domains and their subdomains;
- Chat and push notification services hosts and their subdomains;
- Mining, cryptojacking and malicious domains and their subdomains.

Also this list blocks many spam, adult, gambling and illegal pharmacy selling hosts. You can use it any way you want, but i recommend using it with the desktop versions of <b><a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-mac/overview.html">AdGuard</a></b>. The file will be updated regularly.

## Note:

My filter is optimized for use <b>ONLY</b> in <b><a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome">AdGuard Home</a></b>. Please do not convert it to hosts or Pi-hole syntaxes! Feel free to contact me with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blocked.
